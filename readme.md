## Important Reminders:
* Ensure you are using **[Go 1.19.1](https://go.dev/doc/go1.19)**! Notably, the `max()` and `min()` built-in functions were added in Go 1.21, and will not compile on the grading server. **Triple check your go version**: `go version`.
* Please try to avoid committing large log files - the grading servers only have so much disk space, and too many large log files can prevent your code from being pulled (and graded) correctly.
